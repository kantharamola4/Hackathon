# System Architecture & Component Breakdown

## Enterprise-Grade Architecture Overview

- **Omnichannel User Interface Layer**: Supports CLI, Web, Mobile, Voice, and Messaging platforms. Handles authentication, localization, and channel-specific features.
- **NLU/NLP Engine**: Advanced intent detection, entity extraction, sentiment analysis, and language detection. Integrates with LLMs and custom models.
- **Dialogue Policy Manager**: Manages multi-turn, multi-intent, and context-switching conversations. Supports slot-filling, interruption, and topic resumption.
- **Context & State Store**: Persistent, session-based memory for user profiles, conversation history, slots, and task progress. Supports distributed storage (e.g., Redis, DB).
- **Task Orchestrator & Workflow Engine**: Dynamically routes requests to appropriate banking workflows, supports async task execution, and manages multi-agent collaboration (e.g., escalation to human agent, compliance bot, etc.).
- **Microservices API Layer**: Modular services for loan, card, account, KYC, fraud, notifications, and more. Communicates via REST/gRPC, supports retries, circuit breakers, and observability.
- **Event Bus & Async Processing**: Event-driven architecture for long-running or external tasks (e.g., loan approval, document upload). Supports pub/sub, queues, and webhooks.
- **Fallback, Clarification & Escalation Module**: Handles ambiguity, incomplete info, errors, and escalates to human or specialized bots as needed.
- **Security & Compliance Layer**: Handles authentication, authorization, audit logging, PII masking, and regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).
- **Monitoring, Analytics & Feedback**: Tracks user satisfaction, NLU accuracy, task completion, and system health. Supports dashboards and alerting.
- **Extensibility & Plugin Framework**: Allows rapid addition of new banking products, languages, and integrations.

## Voice & Web Front-End Integration

### Voice Interface
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Converts user’s spoken input to text (e.g., Google Speech API, Azure Speech, or open-source like Vosk).
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts assistant’s responses to natural-sounding audio (e.g., Amazon Polly, Azure TTS, or open-source alternatives).
- **Voice Gateway**: Handles audio streaming, manages session state, and integrates with the Dialogue Manager.
- **Voice UX**: Supports barge-in (interruptions), error recovery, and multi-language.

### Web Front-End
- **Modern Web App (React/Next.js/Vue)**: Provides chat UI, voice input (microphone), and voice output (audio playback).
- **WebSocket/REST API**: Real-time communication between front-end and backend assistant.
- **Authentication & User Profile**: Secure login, session management, and personalization.
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and responsive design.

### Tech Stack Suggestions
- **Voice**: Google Speech-to-Text, Amazon Polly, Azure Speech, or Vosk (open-source)
- **Web Front-End**: React (with Material UI or Chakra UI), Web Audio API for mic/audio, WebSocket for real-time chat
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI), Node.js, or similar
- **APIs**: REST/gRPC for integration

### Integration Flow
1. User speaks or types in the web/voice UI.
2. Voice UI uses STT to convert speech to text.
3. Web/Voice UI sends text to backend via API/WebSocket.
4. Backend processes input, manages dialogue, and generates response.
5. For voice, backend response is sent to TTS and played back to user.
6. For web, response is shown in chat and optionally played as audio.

## Dialogue Flow & Context Handling
- **Multi-turn, goal-oriented flows**: Each workflow is a state machine with slot-filling, validation, and dynamic branching.
- **Context tracking**: User profile, session memory, and task progress are persisted and shared across channels.
- **Dynamic intent/entity recognition**: Supports topic shifts, interruptions, and multi-intent utterances.
- **Fallbacks & escalation**: Clarifies missing/ambiguous info, handles errors, and escalates to human or expert bots.
- **Task delegation**: Orchestrator invokes microservices, handles async events, and notifies user on completion.
- **Compliance & security**: All actions are logged, sensitive data is masked, and user consent is tracked.

## Example: Loan Application (Complex Flow)
1. User: "I want a home loan for $200,000."
2. NLU extracts: intent=loan_application, type=home, amount=200000
3. Dialogue Policy checks for missing info (e.g., tenure, income, documents)
4. System: "What is your preferred tenure?"
5. User: "15 years."
6. Dialogue Policy validates, updates context, and triggers KYC microservice
7. If KYC passes, orchestrator submits application via Loan API
8. If approval is async, user is notified via event bus when done
9. All steps are logged, and user can resume or switch topics anytime

## Limitations & Potential Enhancements
- Real-time fraud detection, biometric authentication, and voice biometrics
- Integration with core banking and third-party fintech APIs
- Multi-language, multi-region, and accessibility support
- Continuous learning from user feedback and analytics
- Advanced privacy controls and explainable AI
